make.bash creates a Google Compute Engine VM image to run the Go
FreeBSD builder, booting up to run the bootstrapswarm command.

make.bash should be run on a Linux box with qemu and a few additional packages.
on ubuntu 20.04:
    apt-get install qemu-system-x86 qemu-utils expect genisoimage
    ./make.bash 14.2

After it completes, it creates a file freebsd-amd64-142.tar.gz.

Then:
    make upload-prod
Or just use the web UI at:
    https://console.developers.google.com/project/symbolic-datum-552/storage/browser/go-builder-data/

Then:
    make delete-image-prod
    make create-image-prod
